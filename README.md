# Tim's Personal Statement

This is my personal statement, in progress, for applying to universities in the UK in academic year 2012/13.

## Personal statement *(preview)*


I believe that I am an ideal candidate for undergraduate study because I am intelligent and hard-working, I love my chosen subject and finally I have life and work experience that prepares me to study at a higher level.

In both education and employment, I have demonstrated my intelligence, discipline, and self-motivation. 

I excelled in both my GCSE and A Level exams whilst pursuing my favoured subjects in further depth. During my A Levels, I was selected to attend the Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford. There, I debated political issues with the brightest politics students in the country. Further, for the 2010 General Election, I organised a "Question Time" event for local parliamentary candidates at my sixth form college. 

I have always sought employment outside of my studies. Currently, I am working full-time in a technology startup, GoCardless. Having started as an intern, I expanded my role to take sole responsibility for customer service. Most recently, I implemented a new phone system which dramatically improved call quality and introduced tracking to inform business decisions.

I have long-held love for what I want to study which inspires me to want to take it further. 

A defining moment for my interest in politics was when at the age of eleven I made a speech to nearly 1000 people representing the Labour Party. Politics is such an important field because it affects our lives in so many ways. No matter our aspirations, political decisions have an important impact, they are not irrelevant. I am studying an online digital democracy course from University of Michigan, and my reading of texts on the political systems of Europe and beyond is greatly broadening my knowledge.

Philosophy also captivates me since it seeks to answer questions which are so fundamental to the human experience. Understandinh philosophy and particularly the intellectual skills this fosters is of great importance to me. It is also relevant to my faith, with the debates challenging my beliefs and encouraging me to think. For instance, Plato's dissection of the piety in "Euthyphro" has encouraged me to consider more the foundations of Christian morality.

I have three goals in my university experience: to gain academic knowledge of my field; to hone and gain research and other academic skills and to develop my ideas and debate with other passionnate students.

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London. I did not find the course sufficiently challenging considering that my primary aim is to learn as much as possible. The course looked at many areas, but only in a trivial way. My coursemates also seemed not to share my passion and dedication, meaning a lack of scope for discussion.

Since beginning employment in February, working alongside colleagues who attended the country's top universities has shown me that what I seek is there to gain, and my leading position has reaffirmed my belief in the power of independent hard work. Now I firmly believe that I am ready to return to study with a refreshed outlook and greater maturity, studying an academic course where I will be able to learn, develop and debate.

In conclusion, I look forward to the opportunities that university study will present me, both academically and otherwise. My education and employment so far have put me in an ideal position to begin. I have no doubt that my studies at university will allow me to further develop and will prepare me for my future career.
