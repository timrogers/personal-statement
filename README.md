# Tim's Personal Statement

This is my personal statement, in progress, for applying to universities in the UK in academic year 2012/13.

This is mainly for me to keep track and benefit from the ability to revert and the like.

Thoughts (and pull requests!) are appreciated. Do not plaigirise this - it's against the UCAS rules.
