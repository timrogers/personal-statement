* Intellectual rigour and wider skills
 * Skills to transfer into employment and life
 * Particularly fostered by philosophy - thinking beyond the surface of what we perceive to be "reality" - didn't study this before
 * Research and persuasion skills - fostered and useful for employment of all kinds
  * Seen the value of these skills in work

* Content
 * Too broad with seven or eight subjects - little chance to go deep
  * Language element took up time where I could have been learning crazy amounts of content
 * A thirst for knowledge and facts - for instance, I find the specifics of laws really interesting <=> politics
 * Fundamental subjects useful for all kinds of work (probably a bullshit point)

* Challenge
 * Other engaged people to debate with and challenge my own ideas - a thirst for self-improvement
 * Colleagues at work have proven what is available and the quality of argument and intellect I can find
 * A preparation for future success
 
These points refer more not to specific flaws of UCL, but flaws in my choice of course - less slander! I also seek to show how my experience of work has fed my desire to go to university.

I'd like to be able to refer to UCL and employment in every point, but I'm not sure it's practical.
