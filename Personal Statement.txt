*Something will go here. I'm doing this bit last because it's horrible.*

In my GCSE and A Level exams, I excelled across a range of subjects and I look forward to being able to continue onwards with my formal studies at an undergraduate level.

Outside of preparations for examinations, I always try to go further, getting involved more deeply in what I'm studying. Following my studies in politics, I was selected to attend the Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford, giving me the chance to debate political issues amongst the brightest politics students in the country.

In my sixth form, I also organised a "Question Time" style event running alongside 2010's General Election, getting the chance to meet and speak with local prospective parliamentary candidates, and I represented Labour in a mock election, compiling a speech on policies and taking part in a public debate.

I've also always enjoyed reading further into my subjects, from reading French literature and poetry to investigating in depth the French political system.

Even since having left school, I have really enjoyed having the opportunity to pursue my academic interests further, seeking to broaden my knowledge across the social sciences and philosophy.

In the political field, I am particularly interested in comparative politics and especially in the theory and practice behind the European Union, having developed my knowledge through reading Hix's "The Political System of the European Union". My interest in constitutions and their place in the state system encouraged me to look at different instances of constitutionalism, reading "The Government and Politics of France" by Knapp and McKay's "American Politics and Society".

I've taken my first steps in the study of philosophy, with Blackburn's "Think" providing a useful foundation on the various basic issues of the field. Since reading that, I've moved onto classic texts such as those of Plato. I found Plato's commentary on piety in Euthyphro particularly captivating, encouraging me really to consider the different perspectives on morality and challenging me as a Christian.

Based upon the latest worldwide events, my academic knowledge and reading and with my own opinions, I frequently write online articles analysing philosophical, political and economic issues, considering and evaluating the differing arguments and putting forward original ideas.

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London, but I did not find the course sufficiently challenging and inspiring and I wanted to take the chance to work in a field of huge interest to me, technology, so I decided to leave and take up a job at a financial technology startup, GoCardless.

There, I take complete responsibility for customer support and communication with clients, not only providing day-to-day service but also making business decisions, optimising processes and acting as an interface between the outside world and the team of developers who build the product.

Whether working independently or collaboratively with colleagues, I am always a self-starter and I am keen to work hard to produce the best results possible.

My leading role in such a small but highly skilled environment has provided me with great opportunities to mature and learn new skills, but I still keenly look forward to the opportunity to return to academic study, further developing my skills and working hard to gain everything I possibly can from the university experience.

Outside of employment, I'm an active member of London's technology community, attending events and often speaking on technological topics and contributing with my free time to open source projects.

I am also active in my local church, where I enjoy studying the Bible alongside other young people, but also helping look after young children and working on the church website.

In conclusion, I believe that I am a highly motivated and mature student and I look forward to the opportunities that university study will present me, both academically and otherwise. I have no doubt that my choice of subject will prepare me well for my future career, and it will provide me with the chance to develop a whole range of other skills.
