I believe I am an ideal candidate for undergraduate study because I am intelligent and hard working, I love my chosen subject and I have experience that prepares me to study at a higher level.

In both education and employment, I have demonstrated my intelligence, discipline, and self-motivation. 

I excelled in both my GCSE and A Level exams achieving straight As and A*s whilst pursuing my favoured subjects in further depth. During my A Levels, I was selected to attend the Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford. There, I debated political issues with the brightest politics students in the country. 

I have always sought employment outside of my studies. Currently, I am working full-time in a technology startup, GoCardless. Having started as an intern, I expanded my role to take sole responsibility for customer service. Most recently, I planned and implemented a new phone system which dramatically improved call quality and introduced case tracking to inform business decisions.

I have a love for what I want to study which inspires me to take it further. 

Whilst many of my peers feel that politics is irrelevant, I have long been fascinated by the subject. Politics is such an important field because it affects our lives in so many ways, no matter our aspirations. 

My enthusiasm for politics and debate is long-standing. At age 11, I represented he Labour Party in a mock election speech at school. Four years later, I did the same again. Further, for the 2010 General Election, I organised a "Question Time" event for local parliamentary candidates at my sixth form college. Currently I am broadening my knowledge by studying an course from University of Michigan on digital democracy and reading texts on the politics of Europe and beyond. 

Philosophy captivates me since it seeks to answer questions which are so fundamental to the human experience. As a Christian, I have always looked further than the surface. My initial readings in philosophy have made me look deeper still. For instance, Plato's dissection of the piety in "Euthyphro" has encouraged me to reconsider the moral foundations of my faith, reconciling the idea of the fundamentally good God whom I follow with the internal contradictions raised through Socrates.

I have three motivations for attending university: to gain academic knowledge; to hone my research and other academic skills and to develop and debate my own ideas with other passionate students

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London. I found the course too broad considering that my primary aim is to gain as deep an understanding as possible. The course looked at many areas, but only in a trivial way. My fellow students seemed also not to share my passion and dedication, meaning a lack of scope for discussion.

Since beginning employment in February, my work alongside colleagues who attended the country's top universities has reinforced by my belief in the value of further study. My achievements in the company have reaffirmed my belief in independent hard work. Now I am certain that I am ready to return to study with a refreshed outlook and greater maturity, following an academic course where I will be able to learn, develop and debate.

In conclusion, I look forward to the opportunities that university presents, both academically and otherwise. My education and employment so far have put me in an ideal position to begin. I have no doubt that undergraduate studies will allow me to further develop and will prepare me for my future career.
