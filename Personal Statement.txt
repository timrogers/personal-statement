As we look at the society around us which forms the very basis for our existence, we are led by our very nature to question everything, from the best way for society to be organised politically to the very meaning of our lives in this world and even the universe. All this has naturally brought me towards an interest in the social sciences and philosophy.

The world of politics has long captivated me. From watching the impact of social media on political movements in the Arab Spring of 2011 to analysing the debates that fuelled the General Election here in the UK in 2010, politics offers a wide range of deep and contentious issues to consider and debate. My interest in the subject is well explained in French political scientist Raymond Aron’s book ‘L’opium des intellectuels’, which memorably describes communism as a ‘secular religion’ – to me, this perfectly captures how issues surrounding the political realm are not only important to people and deeply held, but incredibly divisive. This makes politics an exciting field to study, and one where I enjoyed working at A Level and which I have continued to pursue since then. I have a particular interest in constitutions and their place in the democratic state system, as well as a wider one in comparative politics and especially the European Union. I found Hix's look at the possible directions for the European project in "The Political System of the European Union" to be particularly thought-provoking.

Economics is also strongly of interest to me - I enjoyed my studies of it at both GCSE level and as one of my A2 subjects, and I particularly enjoy the more political aspect of economics, and the different policies which governments have available to enact (or according to some, not enact) to manage and manipulate the market. The powerful disagreements between the Keynesian school and the more free-market side, in the mould of Milton Friedman, are an excellent example of where two ideological groups bring different economic ideas to the table, each backed by formal economic theory, creating an interesting debate.

At the same time, I have begun in my studies of Philosophy. Reading around the area has proved to be interesting, showing me different perspectives and debates on issues which I’ve only considered alone before, ranging from the origins of morality to the extent to which we should trust our own senses and perceptions. I began with Blackburn's "Think" which provided a well-rounded introduction to the various basic issues of philosophy, and since then, the works of Plato have particularly captivated me, especially with his examinations through Socrates of piety, which have intrigued and challenged me as a Christian, forcing me to consider all the more the origins of "the good".

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London. However, I did not find this course sufficiently challenging and inspiring and did not feel at home at the university, and so I moved to leave in January 2012, moving into full-time work at a small technology venture, GoCardless, operating in the financial space and described by The Guardian as a company "widely tipped for the big time”. There I have had amazing opportunities to work with a highly experienced team both collaboratively and independently. My role in the business includes a wide range of responsibilities from providing support to end users to developing new solutions to improve the efficiency of the business's customer relations. Despite the great experience and skills I have gained from taking full time employment in a fast-growing company, I look forward to returning to full-time academic work fresh with newly gained skills and maturity.

Whilst working, I've ensured that I keep up with current affairs and academic reading. In my spare time, I enjoy reading political magazines and journals, attending open lectures at the LSE and reading academic materials in both politics and philosophy. Based upon the latest worldwide events, my academic knowledge and my opinions, I frequently write online articles analysing philosophical and political, considering and evaluating the arguments on each side and putting forward my own original ideas. I’m an active member of London’s technology community, releasing my work into the public domain, I take part in Labour Party activities in my local area and I regularly help out at my local church, looking after young children and studying the Bible with others.

From my experience at university, I hope to gain a wide field of knowledge on my chosen subject, preparing me academically for a future career, with a view to hopefully one day becoming a politician. Beyond these specific topic areas, I look forward to having the amazing opportunity to develop my skills at university, from argument analysis to academic research, and to fully integrating myself into university life and contributing to the community.
