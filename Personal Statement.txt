*Something will go here. I'm doing this bit last because it's horrible.*

In my GCSE and A Level exams, I excelled across a range of subjects and I look forward to being able to continue onwards with my formal studies at an undergraduate level.

Outside of preparations for examinations, I always try to go further, getting involved more deeply in what I'm studying. Alongside my A2 work in politics, I applied and was selected to attend the annual Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford, giving me the chance to debate political issues with the brightest politics students in the country.

In my sixth form, I also organised a "Question Time" style event running alongside 2010's General Election, getting the chance to meet and speak with local prospective parliamentary candidates, and I represented the Labour Party in a mock election, compiling a speech on policies and taking part in a public debate.

I have long enjoyed reading further into my subjects, from reading French novels and poetry to investigating in-depth the French political system.

Since having left school, I have really enjoyed having the opportunity to spending more time in pursuing my academic interests further, seeking to broaden my knowledge across the social sciences and philosophy.

In the political field, I am interested in comparative politics and especially in the theory and practice behind the European Union, having developed my knowledge through reading Hix's "The Political System of the European Union". My interest in constitutions and their place in the state system also encouraged me to look at different instances of constitutionalism around the world, studying France and the USA in "The Government and Politics of France" by Knapp and McKay's "American Politics and Society" as two notable examples.

I've also taken my first steps in the philosophy, with Blackburn's "Think" providing a useful foundation, introducing the basic issues to be considered. Since then, I've moved onto classic texts such as those of Plato where I have found the disection of the concept of piety in "Euthyphro" to be particularly captivating, encouraging me to more fully consider the different perspectives on morality and challenging me as a Christian.

Based upon the latest worldwide events, academic study and my own opinions, I greatly enjoy writing online articles analysing philosophical, political and economic issues, considering and evaluating the differing arguments and putting forward original ideas.

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London, but I did not find the course sufficiently challenging and inspiring. Not content to rest on my laurels, I opted to take the chance to work in a field of huge interest to me, technology, so I left to take up a job at a technology startup in the financial field, GoCardless.

There, I am now working full time and I take complete responsibility for customer support and communication with clients, not only providing day-to-day service but also making business decisions, optimising processes and acting as the interface between the outside world and the team of developers who build the product.

Whether working independently or collaboratively with colleagues, I am always a self-starter and I am keen to work hard to produce the best results possible.

My leading role in such a small but highly skilled environment has provided me with great opportunities to mature and learn new skills, but I still keenly look forward to the opportunity to return to academic study to further develop my skills and broaden my horizons for the future.

Outside of employment, I'm an active member of London's technology community, attending events and often speaking on technological topics and contributing with my free time to open source projects.

I am also present in my local church, where I enjoy studying the Bible alongside other young people, but also helping look after young children and assisting on the church website.

In conclusion, I believe that I am a highly motivated and mature student and I look forward to the opportunities that university study will present me, both academically and otherwise. 

My education and employment so far have put me in an ideal starting position, and I have no doubt that my studies at university will allow me to further develop and will prepare me for my future career.
