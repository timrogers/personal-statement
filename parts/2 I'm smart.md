In my GCSE and A Level exams, I excelled across a range of subjects and I look forward to being able to continue onwards with my formal studies at an undergraduate level.

Outside of preparations for examinations, I always try to go further, getting involved more deeply in what I'm studying. Following my studies in politics, I was selected to attend the Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford, giving me the chance to debate political issues amongst the brightest politics students in the country.

In my sixth form, I also organised a "Question Time" style event running alongside 2010's General Election, getting the chance to meet and speak with local prospective parliamentary candidates, and I represented Labour in a mock election, compiling a speech on policies and taking part in a public debate.

I've also always enjoyed reading further into my subjects, from reading French literature and poetry to investigating in depth the French political system.
