In both education and employment, I have demonstrated my intelligence, discipline, and self-motivation. 

I excelled in both my GCSE and A Level exams achieving straight As and A*s whilst pursuing my favoured subjects in further depth. During my A Levels, I was selected to attend the Dicey Conference at Trinity College, Oxford. There, I debated political issues with the brightest politics students in the country. 

I have always sought employment outside of my studies. Currently, I am working full-time in a technology startup, GoCardless. Having started as an intern, I expanded my role to take sole responsibility for customer service. Most recently, I planned and implemented a new phone system which dramatically improved call quality and introduced case tracking to inform business decisions.
