I have three goals in my university experience: to gain academic knowledge of my field; to hone and gain research and other academic skills and to develop my ideas and debate with other passionnate students.

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London. I did not find the course sufficiently challenging considering that my primary aim is to learn as much as possible. The course looked at many areas, but only in a trivial way. My coursemates also seemed not to share my passion and dedication, meaning a lack of scope for discussion.

Since beginning employment in February, working alongside colleagues who attended the country's top universities has shown me that what I seek is there to gain, and my leading position has reaffirmed my belief in the power of independent hard work. Now I firmly believe that I am ready to return to study with a refreshed outlook and greater maturity, studying an academic course where I will be able to learn, develop and debate.
