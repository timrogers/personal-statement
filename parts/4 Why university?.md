Having already spent a term at university, I am clear about what I want from the experience: to develop the way I think; to immerse myself in subjects I love; and to continue to interact with brilliant and passionate students.

In September 2011, I started at UCL studying European Social and Political Studies. With hindsight, choosing a course with a 50% language element was not the right decision. Whilst I enjoyed the breadth of the course, the emphasis on French left little time for other areas. In February I decided to leave and pursue a job offer from GoCardless with a view to returning to study in future.

My time at work has only increased my desire to return to university. I work with exceptionally talented people who have a depth of thought I now realise I can only gain from further study. I also miss spending time in the library trying to understand new concepts and being able to focus on politics. Working has also reinforced my belief in hard work, which I am determined to apply to my studies.
