I have three motivations for attending university: to gain academic knowledge; to hone my research and other academic skills and to develop and debate my own ideas with other passionate students

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London. I found the course too broad considering that my primary aim is to gain as deep an understanding as possible. The course looked at many areas, but only in a trivial way. My fellow students seemed also not to share my passion and dedication, meaning a lack of scope for discussion.

Since beginning employment in February, my work alongside colleagues who attended the country's top universities has reinforced by my belief in the value of further study. My achievements in the company have reaffirmed my belief in independent hard work. Now I am certain that I am ready to return to study with a refreshed outlook and greater maturity, following an academic course where I will be able to learn, develop and debate.
