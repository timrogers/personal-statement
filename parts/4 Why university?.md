Finally, I know what I wish to gain from university and how I will do. I have three goals for my university study: for one, I want to gain academic knowledge of my field. Secondly, I wish to hone and gain transferable skills such as the ability to research fully and present arguments clearly and effectively. Thirdly, I want to study alongside other engaged and passionnate people with whom I can develop my opinions and debate.

In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London, but I did not find the course sufficiently challenging and inspiring. My primary motivation for undergraduate study is to learn as much as possible in the formal sense, but the structure of the course looking at so many different areas in only a trivial way did not allow me to do this. I also found that my fellow students did not seem to share my passion and dedication to hard independent work, meaning there were few people with whom I could debate and discussed what I had learnt.

Since leaving in February, my experience working alongside my colleagues who attended the country's top universities has shown me that what I seek is available at university, and my leading role in work has reaffirmed my belief in the power of hard work, leaving me looking forward to the challenge of academia. I now firmly believe that I am ready to return to study with a refreshed outlook and greater maturity, hoping to study an academic course where I will be able to learn, develop and debate and gain massively from the entire experience.
