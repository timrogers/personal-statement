As we look at the society around us which forms the very basis for our existence, we are led by our very nature to question everything, from the best way for society to be organised politically to the very meaning of our lives in this world and even the universe. All this has naturally brought me towards an interest in the social sciences and philosophy.

The world of politics has long captivated me. From watching the impact of social media on political movements in the Arab Spring of 2011 to analysing the debates that fuelled the General Election here in the UK in 2010, politics offers a wide range of deep and contentious issues to consider and debate. 

My interest in the subject is well explained in French political scientist Raymond Aron’s book ‘L’opium des intellectuels’, which memorably describes communism as a ‘secular religion’ – to me, this perfectly captures how issues surrounding the political realm are not only important to people and deeply held, but incredibly divisive. This makes politics an exciting field to study, and one where I enjoyed working at A Level and which I have continued to pursue since then. 

I have a particular interest in constitutions and their place in the democratic state system, as well as a wider one in comparative politics and especially the European Union. I found Hix's look at the possible directions for the European project in "The Political System of the European Union" to be particularly thought-provoking.

Economics is also strongly of interest to me - I enjoyed my studies of it at both GCSE level and as one of my A2 subjects, and I particularly enjoy the more political aspect of economics, and the different policies which governments have available to enact (or according to some, not enact) to manage and manipulate the market.
