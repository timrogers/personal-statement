I have long-held love for what I want to study which inspires me to want to take it further. 

A defining moment for my interest in politics was when at the age of eleven I made a speech to nearly 1000 people representing the Labour Party. Politics is such an important field because it affects our lives in so many ways. No matter our aspirations, political decisions have an important impact, they are not irrelevant. I am studying an online digital democracy course from University of Michigan, and my reading of texts on the political systems of Europe and beyond is greatly broadening my knowledge.

Philosophy also captivates me since it seeks to answer questions which are so fundamental to the human experience. Understandinh philosophy and particularly the intellectual skills this fosters is of great importance to me. It is also relevant to my faith, with the debates challenging my beliefs and encouraging me to think. For instance, Plato's dissection of the piety in "Euthyphro" has encouraged me to consider more the foundations of Christian morality.
