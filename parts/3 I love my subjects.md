Since having left school, I have really enjoyed having the opportunity to spending more time in pursuing my academic interests further, seeking to broaden my knowledge across the social sciences and philosophy.

In the political field, I am interested in comparative politics and especially in the theory and practice behind the European Union, having developed my knowledge through reading Hix's "The Political System of the European Union". My interest in constitutions and their place in the state system also encouraged me to look at different instances of constitutionalism around the world, studying France and the USA in "The Government and Politics of France" by Knapp and McKay's "American Politics and Society" as two notable examples.

I've also taken my first steps in the philosophy, with Blackburn's "Think" providing a useful foundation, introducing the basic issues to be considered. Since then, I've moved onto classic texts such as those of Plato where I have found the disection of the concept of piety in "Euthyphro" to be particularly captivating, encouraging me to more fully consider the different perspectives on morality and challenging me as a Christian.

Based upon the latest worldwide events, academic study and my own opinions, I greatly enjoy writing online articles analysing philosophical, political and economic issues, considering and evaluating the differing arguments and putting forward original ideas.
