I have a love for what I want to study which inspires me to take it further. 

A defining moment for my long-held active interest in politics was when I made a speech in an assembly in my first weeks of secondary school representing the Labour Party. My enthusiasm has continued, with me doing the same in my final year. Politics is such an important field because it affects our lives in so many ways, no matter our aspirations. It is by no means irrelevant. Presently, I am studying an online digital democracy course from University of Michigan, and my reading of texts on the politics of Europe and beyond is greatly broadening my knowledge.

Philosophy captivates me since it seeks to answer questions which are so fundamental to the human experience. An understanding of philosophy and the intellectual skills this fosters is of great importance to me. It is also relevant to my faith, challenging me to re-evaluate my beliefs. For instance, Plato's dissection of the piety in "Euthyphro" has encouraged me to consider more the foundations of Christian morality.
