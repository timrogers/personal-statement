I have a love for what I want to study which inspires me to take it further. 

Whilst many of my peers feel that politics is irrelevant, I have long been fascinated by the subject. Politics is such an important field because it affects our lives in so many ways, no matter our aspirations. 

My enthusiasm for politics and debate is long-standing. At age 11, I represented he Labour Party in a mock election speech at school. Four years later, I did the same again. Further, for the 2010 General Election, I organised a "Question Time" event for local parliamentary candidates at my sixth form college. Currently I am broadening my knowledge by studying an course from University of Michigan on digital democracy and reading texts on the politics of Europe and beyond. 

Philosophy captivates me since it seeks to answer questions which are so fundamental to the human experience. As a Christian, I have always looked further than the surface. My initial readings in philosophy have made me look deeper still. For instance, Plato's dissection of the piety in "Euthyphro" has encouraged me to consider more the foundations of Christian morality.
