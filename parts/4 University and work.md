In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London, but I did not find the course sufficiently challenging and inspiring and I wanted to take the chance to work in a field of huge interest to me, technology, so I decided to leave and take up a job at a financial technology startup, GoCardless.

There, I take complete responsibility for customer support and communication with clients, not only providing day-to-day service but also making business decisions, optimising processes and acting as an interface between the outside world and the team of developers who build the product.

Whether working independently or collaboratively with colleagues, I am always a self-starter and I am keen to work hard to produce the best results possible.

My leading role in such a small but highly skilled environment has provided me with great opportunities to mature and learn new skills, but I still keenly look forward to the opportunity to return to academic study, further developing my skills and working hard to gain everything I possibly can from the university experience.
