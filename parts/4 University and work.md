In September 2011, I began studying European Social and Political Studies at University College London, but I did not find the course sufficiently challenging and inspiring. Not content to rest on my laurels, I opted to take the chance to work in a field of huge interest to me, technology, so I left to take up a job at a technology startup in the financial field, GoCardless.

There, I am now working full time and I take complete responsibility for customer support and communication with clients, not only providing day-to-day service but also making business decisions, optimising processes and acting as the interface between the outside world and the team of developers who build the product.

Whether working independently or collaboratively with colleagues, I am always a self-starter and I am keen to work hard to produce the best results possible.

My leading role in such a small but highly skilled environment has provided me with great opportunities to mature and learn new skills, but I still keenly look forward to the opportunity to return to academic study to further develop my skills and broaden my horizons for the future.
